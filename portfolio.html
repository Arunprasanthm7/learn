              Sankalp is an incredibly talented designer as well as an intelligent, curious, and self-motivated
              individual.
              When tackling a design challenge, he puts extreme care into every interaction along the user journey. His
              aesthetic is simultaneously thoughtful and playful‚Äîand always centered around the user's needs.

              He gracefully articulates his viewpoint‚Äîwhich always comes from a solid foundation of rational thought and
              customer-centricity. On top of all of this, he is a really nice guy and is downright fun to work with.

            <div class="testPara">
              I would highly recommend anyone considering hiring or working with Sankalp to consider him. I would do the
              same in a heartbeat.
